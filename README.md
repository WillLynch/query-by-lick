Development
-----------

I have been using QT Designer to generate the mainwindows.py file. If you make changes to this file manually, they will
be lost! If you make changes to the QueryByLick.ui file in QT Designer, run

C:\Python34\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5\pyuic5.bat -x QueryByLick.ui -o mainwindow.py

within the project directory to update the generated python code.
